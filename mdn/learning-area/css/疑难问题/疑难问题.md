# width:auto vs. width:100%
Width auto

The initial width of a block level element like div or p is auto. This makes it expand to occupy all available horizontal space within its containing block. If it has any horizontal padding or border, the widths of those do not add to the total width of the element.

Width 100%

On the other hand, if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus any horizontal margin, padding and border (unless you’ve used box-sizing:border-box, in which case only margins are added to the 100% to change how its total width is calculated). This may be what you want, but most likely it isn’t.

# reflow vs. repaint
A repaint occurs when changes are made to an elements skin that changes visibly, but do not affect its layout.

Examples of this include  outline, visibility, background, or color. According to Opera, repaint is expensive because the browser must verify the visibility of all other nodes in the DOM tree.

A reflow is even more critical to performance because it involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page).

Examples that cause reflows include: adding or removing content, explicitly or implicitly changing  width, height, font-family, font-size and more.
